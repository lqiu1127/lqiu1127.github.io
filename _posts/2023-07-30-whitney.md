07/27 8pm land in LAX, 12 passenger van is huge and managed to fit 7 people's stuff. Note that most credit cards only cover insurance for vans up to 8 people, so this car wasnt covered by the credit card's insurnace. Our luggage is delayed by 90 minutes, pushing our hotel arrival by that much.

07/28 1am Got In-and-Out for dinner on the way, still the same goodness; arrived at the hotel after driving fairly fast on empty roads. Really grateful for YL pushing back on landing and hiking in the same day. I thought about landing at 9am and then starting the hike around 1pm the same day. My decision was way too pushy on the schedule and I can't imagine what else would go wrong if we continued down that timeline.

7/28 9am I finished packing early and went to buy water for the team. I did not get the product requirement correctly and delivered the wrong product (bought 22L of water in large containers but several people needed water bottles instead). Bad decision, low consequence, since people got water again while I got gas.

My backpack Osprey Atmos 65, second heaviest backpack in the group. On AllTrails someone reported they packed in 60lbs, not sure if they wanted to move up there.

7/28 12pm start hike, 38lb pack, 22lb for LS, close to our heaviest packs during training. I can imagine how the pack can get heavier with more mountaineering gear. There were a lot of water crossing. The water is knee deep sometimes but you can rock hop and the friction is pretty solid.

7/28 3:30pm We met a ranger checking permits at Outpost camp 4 miles in, it was pretty critical that we got some kind of a condition update here.  Originally I thought that we would leave at 5am so the snow would be in microspikes condition, but the ranger said that snow was never freezing over the nights and the slush hours begins around 5/6am, so we moved our starting hour to 2/3am instead.

07/28 5pm there was a 3ft wide waterfall creek near Trailside Meadows the ranger warned us about. CJS wanted to jump over it, we both decide against it after checking with SJS and LS. Two other people jumped over the next day without issues. Good decision, medium consequence.

07/28 6pm got to Trail camp at 12,000ft later than I expected, never underestimate elevation + heavy pack; again, YL's decision about sleeping a day near trailhead gave our plan a lot more buffer. Campsite was great, camp food was terrible, only 2/5 packs we ate on trail this trip was good. Stove wouldn't light up with the built in ignitor, reviews indicate that I did not turn on gas high enough, need more gas flow at high altitude, always bring a back up fire starter.

07/28 9pm-11pm, cant fall asleep, camp food brewing in stomach, why do they put beans in almost everything? Tried to practice active rest, but didn't have time to read more about it before leaving so not sure it worked.

7/29 2am wake up after a solid 3 hours, eat a bit of breakfast and keep going, I made last minute decision to carry a wag bag. Good decision, medium consequence because LS had a backup but we used both.

07/29 3:30am-7:30am start hiking a little bit later than I expected, the consensus was to take a steep snow chute up, but we couldn't find it in the dark. Ideally I should have scouted out the route on topo and also in person after we got to camp, but we got to camp really late and didnt have time for either. We came across the official trailswitch, I look at the topo and there is one more opportunity to cut back to the chute, so we continued up the switchbacks because it's easier for now.
At this point we are split into two groups (me, LS, CJS, SJS, WC) have microspikes, so we dont have to switch in-between snow and rock traveling. CW and YL have crampons, which are really difficult to walk with so they had to switch gear 5/6 times throughout the switchbacks.

We soon got to the last place to traverse back to the chute. We did not encounter any snow on switchbacks; CJS said the ranger yesterday mentioned that the cables are coming out, which indicates that the steepest section only have a little snow left and thus there isn't much snow elsewhere. We decided to commit to switchbacks but this decision was not communicated well to CW and YL about 15 minutes behind us.

There were three snow traverses where the snow gets to around 45 degrees, maybe 5 out of the 99 switchbacks were sketchy. WC was ahead of us and traversed with ease. There is no bootpack but the snow is solid, not too icy or slushy, good for microspikes. Friction was good and I felt the overall risk was low. I made some solid ice axe anchor spots for the people behind. I didn't feel that tired at trail crest. Hopium: finish by 4pm.

07/29 8am everything breaks down after Trail Crest at 13500ft, it's only 2 miles left until the summit, but the elevation destroyed everyone. It was really windy and cold, we both had to use our WAG bags in-between two cliffs. Final scramble up to the summit is pretty easy, just not really fun anymore because it's only gatekeeping the summit at this point.

07/29 10:23am Mount Whitney 14505ft, summit felt mundane. I felt more relief not losing than the joy of winning. For whatever reason I valued Adams more than Whitney, so much so that I pushed through 2 initial miles of an ankle injury on Adams.

07/29 11:30 Took a sketchy class 3 scramble down by accident, later we found out WC is actually part of a university mountaineering club, she had an easy time but me and Linshu was stuck for a while. Saw CW and YL coming up on our down, hoping they could summit. Calculated that they are one hour behind us, so to be more real, maybe we will get back at 6pm.

07/29 2:30pm everyone made it back to trail crest, we now have to quickly make a decision on how to get down.
1. Switchbacks we came up: slushy, the ice axe anchors are probably super soft now, it would also take a long time.
2. Switchback onto the chute and glissade down, easy to get to the glissade spot, but very steep glissade.
3. Rock scramble onto the well known glissade path we saw some people take safely. I tried 3 different angles and cannot see the rock scramble, but we did see two other groups make it past there.
LS is crying at this point because of the altitude, I think the last time either of us cried was me during Oppenheimer, I don't remember the time before that. I cried again after finishing the hike and listening to some random song (Heavenly Road).
I think this was the biggest decision on this trip. The group was completely divided on these options. There is not really right or wrong anymore at this point, only choice. My argument was that the rock scramble is solid and the glissade path is well known. It will also be faster and thus less time for us to make mistakes. The consequences of our mistakes are also smaller, if we were to misstep and slip during a traverse on the switchbacks, we would slip 100ft+ and hit some rocks at an uncontrollable speed. Where as even though the chute is steep, there is a large flat section at the bottom.
It was at this point that two people came up from the switchbacks and were still going to go to the summit. They asked if we were okay and offered to step a bootpack down the switchback for us since we were in trailrunners and they had much stiffer mountaineering boots. They asked quite a few times, now that I think of it, maybe they were asking for a way out, its really hard to say but I really just wanted to disengage the conversion because I no longer trust someone getting to that point of the trail at 2:30pm. Those people proceeded to summit at 5pm and glissaded down to Trail camp at 8pm. We read on all trails that one of them didn't make it back to the trailhead that night after being hypothermic from the glissade.

CW and YL arrived soon and we took the last option. The progress was slow, the scramble was steep and the initial traverse to the glissade was steep and slushy. WC went first and traversed onto some rock fields, we cant see her anymore and we arent sure if she was planning on scrambling down. CJS and SJS got to the glissade track and safely glissaded down. LS and me had no gloves and our hands got shredded by the ice getting down. I dropped my ice axe in the middle once somehow, my wrist strap was rather loose. Both of us safely make it down. LS was slightly hypothermic, but better after getting in dryer cloth.
I look back up and I see that WC is way lower than where the glissade track starts and if she doesnt traverse back to the main glissade track, there was a 10 ft cliff at the end of her glissade track. We communicate that to CW, who is acting as a glissade stopper meatshield for YL. All three of them make it down safely eventually as well.

07/29 5pm Everyone gets back to camp and pack up. Our tents are all flipped over, somehow the wind during the day was much faster than last night, I am just happy they didnt fly away. 
Copium: get back by 8pm

07/29 7:30pm We got down to Outpost camp and LS almost faints, her face is numb and cant breath. We later found out its because of low blood sugar, I think both the altitude and hypothermia contributed to this. We boil some water next to a mosquito infested river and made extra food. In the beginning I didnt realize how serious this is, but had to quickly get myself together to make sure she is okay. Other people kept running down and away from the mosquitos. I accepted that we might not be able to get out today, but we have shelter and a bit of food left. I regret not giving the car key to the rest of the group. 

07/29 10pm After a bit LS recovers and our collective anguish and will pushes us through the last 4 miles back to the trailhead. We drove back the 4 hours back to LA.

We escaped the danger today, but what about next time? In terms of results, we got 7/7 people to the summit of Whitney and back, but the process was unorganized and messy. I just treated it as another hike in the backyard, but there was a lot of mountaineering conditions because of the legendary snow pack in Cali this winter.
"the idea that less is more, and doing something means nothing, but how you do it means everything." -KJB
As I reflect back, I dont remember the summit that well, but I vividly remember all the important moments and decisions we made this weekend. This process was so much bigger than the result and I hope we all learned a little bit out of this mountaineering journey. Risk can be reduced by being prepared, by understanding the conditions and consequences, by preparing our bodies to takes on more difficult challenges. We are all going back to things a little more mellow to wrap up this season, I know this experience changed us, I hope its for the better and we will make better decisions in our  future adventures.
